  <h1 class="title">Getting a grip</h1>
  <p>This project was another exploration in problem identication, 
      sketching, prototyping, howver this time in clay. I made a number
    of prototypes of different knife handles, scaling by hand and creating
    laser cut molds.</p>
    <h2 class="title">Sketches</h2>
    <p>I have always felt like pocket knife handles are too slippery. Pocket knife 
        brands and variants usually have little to no texturing to help in grip, 
        and form factor is more or less the same. I decided to make an ergonomic, right 
        handed knife grip that provides additional grip support in holding and in 
        the act of cutting.

    <h2 class="title">Version 1: Simple Riveted Knife Handle</h2>
    <p>I went with a simple, finger grip oriented design for a proof of concept.
        While I felt it did help my grip, I felt like it was uninspired and found 
        the ring/pinky finger slot awkward to hold.

    <h2 class="title">Version 2: Fish Hook</h2>
    <p>Iterating on my previous design, I kept the finger slotting for my pointer 
        and middle fingers, however smoothed out the pinky/ring finger slot. I also 
        added a hooked end to the grip, allowing for significant dragging force on the 
        edge of the hand.

    <h2 class="title">Version 2: Mermaid Tail</h2>
    <p>I went ever further in terms of drag resistance, this time adding curvature to the top 
        of the knife handle, giving stoppage around the palm. I found this to be the most comfortable 
        design, and felt like it would give the greatest assist to users.

    <h2 class="title">Afterthoughts</h2>

    <p> I liked working with clay, however found that the terracotta colored clay we were working with 
        frustrating to deal with, as it cooled fast and become painful to deal with. I want to do more research 
        into the relationship between casting silicon and getting detail textures, as I feel that textures would 
        further enhance grip, but know that they do not always come out well during casting.
